- 👋 Hi, I’m @kc2kth
- 👀 I’m interested in the concept of devops and how it's evolved over the past several years, the tools that enable devops as a function/process, and applying those principles where I can contribute.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can to bring decades old code development skills up to at least a somewhat modern level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can apply existing skills while developing new ones.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well, that shouldn't be too hard.
